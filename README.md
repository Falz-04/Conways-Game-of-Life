# Conways-Game-of-Life
This is my FIRST C++ game!!! Made using Raylib.

## How To Use
When you run the program, you will see a screen open up with a blank grid. When the game is Paused (it will say on the window title):
- Press R to Randomise the Grid
- Press C to Clear the Grid
- Click on the boxes to toggle them to make them alive or dead
- Press Enter to start the game
- Press SPACEBAR to pause the game
